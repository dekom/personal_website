h6. Rely On External API?

Conceivably, the project should use an external API such as this one: ["Wordnik API":http://developer.wordnik.com/docs].  This would simplify the database tremendously with a more consistent and up-to-date word associations.

*Zhi* instead will speficially focus on linking up to Wordnik API to display word definition and other information, and it will store user word lists and allow users to a way to study the stored words.

h6. New Database Layout: Reliance on External API

* An _user_ has many word lists.
* A _word list_ has many words and belongs to an user.
* A _word_ has a list of sources.
